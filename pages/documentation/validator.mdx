For data validation we have developed a composer package called [Validator](https://packagist.org/packages/codesvault/validator)
You can use validator in controller and service classes very easily to validate data.

## Example

```php
$validate = $this->validate( [
	'email' => 'required|email',
	'password' => 'required|min:8'
	'username' => 'required|min:3|max:15|stringOnly'
] );

$error = $validator->error();
if ($error) {
	return $error;
}
$data = $validator->getData();
```
