import Image from 'next/image'

Install the CLI using composer as global package.

```
composer global require codesvault/kathamo-generator
```

Add Composer's system-wide vendor bin directory in your $PATH, so that Kathamo executable can be located by your system.

* macOS: `$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin` or `$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH`
* Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin`
* GNU / Linux Distributions: `$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin or $HOME/.composer/vendor/bin`

<br />
If you've already have added composer's bin folder to your path, you can use the command `kathamo` right away from your terminal.

However, if you prefer not to modify the `PATH` variable, you can also create an alias in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file like below:

`alias kathamo="$(composer config -g home)/vendor/bin/kathamo"`

<br />
<br />

## CLI Usage

Create a new plugin with Kathamo framework. From your terminal run this command
```php bash
kathamo create:plugin
```

<br />

You can also create Controller, Migration file, Middleware, Service, etc using the CLI.
```php bash
kathamo make:controller
kathamo make:migration
kathamo make:middleware
kathamo make:service
```

<br />

## Assets Bundling

Kathamo uses Vite for assets bundling. You can find the Vite configuration file in the `vite.config.js` file.
NPM commands are in `package.json`.
