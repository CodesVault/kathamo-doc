In Kathamo middleware's are just some chunk of business logics that is executed between request and response.

## Create new middleware

To create a new middleware you just need to run the following command in the terminal and provide prompt inputs

```bash
kathamo make:middleware	 # alias make:mw
```

Note: Kathamo espects `handle` method in your middleware class. This method will be executed when the middleware is called.
